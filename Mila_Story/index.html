              I was lucky when I first found you. Through the conversation we
              knew that we looked a lot like each other, and by that we had
              feelings for each other.

              Fate sometimes makes a really precious bond, and I always believe
              that fate exists between us. I have a lot of worries about what I
              will always do for you, such a beautiful and nice person.

              I hope you will always feel my true feelings toward you, and if
              you have a happy life for it is a blessing. Though far away, I'd
              like to come to you as soon as possible and hold you and shout.
